"""
Selenium scraper for Google Maps listings.

Maps needs a real browser session (JS-rendered, infinite-scroll results),
which is why this uses Selenium instead of BeautifulSoup - unlike the
directory sites, which are static HTML (see directory_scraper.py).

Selectors below were built from real inspected HTML (right-click -> Inspect
on a live Maps search) - not guessed. Google's class names are short,
auto-generated strings that can change over time; if this breaks later,
re-inspect a live search the same way and update the selectors here.
